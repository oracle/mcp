# OCI Migration MCP Server

## Overview

This server provides tools for interacting with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Migration service.

## MCP client configuration (recommended)

Most users should configure their MCP client to launch the server, rather than starting it manually.

Add a stanza like this to your MCP client config (often called `mcp.json`; example shown is **stdio**):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "oci-migration": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "oracle.oci-migration-mcp-server"
      ],
      "env": {
        "OCI_CONFIG_PROFILE": "DEFAULT"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Run the server locally (HTTP transport)

Most MCP clients run this server for you over **stdio** (see above). If you want to run the server as a standalone
service and connect to it over HTTP (**streamable HTTP**), you can.

1) Start the server in HTTP mode (choose host/port):

```bash
ORACLE_MCP_HOST=127.0.0.1 ORACLE_MCP_PORT=8000 uvx oracle.oci-migration-mcp-server
```

This will expose the MCP endpoint at:

`http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp`

2) Configure your MCP client to connect via `streamableHttp`:

> Note: MCP client configuration varies by client/tooling. Some clients refer to streamable HTTP as just `http`.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "oci-migration": {
      "type": "streamableHttp",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```
