# OCI Load Balancer MCP Server

This server provides tools for interacting with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Load Balancer service.

## TODO (REMOVE AFTER COMPLETING)

- [ ] Remove the example tools in `./oracle/oci-load_balancer_mcp_server/server.py`
- [ ] Add your own tool(s)
- [ ] Keep test coverage at or above the `main` branch
- [ ] Document the MCP Server in this "README.md"
- [ ] Submit a PR and pass all the checks
