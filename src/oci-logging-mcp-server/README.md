# OCI Logging MCP Server

## Overview

This server provides tools to interact with the OCI Logging resources.
It includes tools to help with managing logging configurations.

## Running the server

### STDIO transport mode

```sh
uvx oracle.oci-logging-mcp-server
```

### HTTP streaming transport mode

```sh
ORACLE_MCP_HOST=<bind_host> \
ORACLE_MCP_PORT=<port> \
ORACLE_MCP_BASE_URL=<public_base_url> \
OCI_REGION=<region> \
IDCS_DOMAIN=<idcs_domain> \
IDCS_CLIENT_ID=<client_id> \
IDCS_CLIENT_SECRET=<client_secret> \
IDCS_AUDIENCE=<audience> \
uvx oracle.oci-logging-mcp-server
```

Register `${ORACLE_MCP_BASE_URL}/auth/callback` in the OCI IAM confidential application. If `IDCS_REQUIRED_SCOPES` is unset, the default is `openid profile email oci_mcp.logging.invoke`.

## Tools

| Tool Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| list_log_groups | List log groups in a given compartment |
| list_logs | List logs in a given log group |
| get_log | Get a log with a given log OCID |

⚠️ **NOTE**: `stdio` uses the configured OCI CLI profile. HTTP uses the authenticated OCI IAM user and does not use the local OCI CLI profile for request authentication.
